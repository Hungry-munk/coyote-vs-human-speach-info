            <h2>General Information</h2>
            <p>
                Coyotes are the most vocal wild canines, their speech consists of multiple complex combinations of barks, yips and howls that they use on a day-to-day basis.
                <br>
                Coyotes are able to produce a variety of crescendos, trills, modulations, pitches, tones, lips ( at the sides) and vocal chords. The makeup of these pattern combinations is unique to each coyote, therefore other family/ pack members can differentiate between each other by their signature howls and sounds. Coyote voices are probably as individual as our own.
