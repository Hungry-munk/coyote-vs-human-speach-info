                <h2>General Information</h2>
                <p>
                    Coyotes are the most vocal wild canines, their speech
                    consists of multiple complex combinations of barks, yips and
                    howls that they use on a day-to-day basis.
                    <br /><br />
                    Coyotes are able to produce a variety of crescendos, trills,
                    modulations, pitches, tones, lips ( at the sides) and vocal
                    chords. The makeup of these pattern combinations is unique
                    to each coyote, therefore other family/ pack members can
                    differentiate between each other by their signature howls
                    and sounds. Coyote voices are probably as individual as our
                    own.

                <h2>How Coyote's communicate</h2>
                <p>
                    Eleven different forms of vocalization have been identified,
                    but more study is required to determine the precise meanings
                    of these sounds. This includes growls, huffs, woofs, barks,
                    bark-howls, lone howls, group yip-howls, whines, greeting
                    songs, and yelps.
                    <br /><br />
                    Coyotes also use body language, including gestures to convey
                    many different messages and they mainly communicate via eye
                    contact and gestures.
                    <br /><br />
                    Warnings, happiness, joy, anger, distress, disapproval,
                    pain, hellos and whereabouts are some of the things coyotes
                    express out-loud, although the majority of communications is
                    quiet.

                <h2>What they use communication for</h2>
                <p>
                    Mother coyotes use calls to signify their pups whether
                    there’s danger, dinner, or other complex feelings. Their
                    distinct yip-howl is used primarily to keep pack members in
                    communication when separated, however it has also been used
                    as a form of conveying a deeper emotion from the animal.
                    <br /><br />
                    They also leave droppings and urinate on surfaces in order
                    to notify other coyotes of their presence and their
                    territory.

                                Humans can initiate speech without prompt unlike animals who need to react.
                                (in order to ask a partner to play, animals need something to play with such as a dead rat. However humans can initiate play without the need of an object.)

                                Most animals communications is stimulus bound, they can only talk about things in the present and can’t communicate about the past or future.
                                ( Humans can talk about what kind of dinner they had a few days ago, however animals can’t and can only talk about what they are currently eating and not what has previously been consumed)

                            <p>Humans choose words to describe visible and non visible objects. The names of these have no relation to the object itself and only has it’s name as all language speakers just decide to call it a certain something. (if someone had seen a table before but had not known it was called a table they would have no way to infer what the word table actually meant because the word has no link to the object)</p>

                        <li>
                            <h3>Creativity:</h3>
                            <p>in animals, their sounds are very fixed and not open-ended. As discussed before, animals also cannot discuss things that don’t exist. Human communication has a hierarchical structure and a level of creativity that is unseen in the animal world.</p>

                            <p>ideas being passed down and communicated through generations. (a tribe teaching songs and story’s to new generations.)</p>

                    Coyotes use some of hockets uniqueness features one being
                    structure, coyotes use bark to convey long distance threat
                    at a low or medium intensity, howls are used to notify their
                    presence to listeners as well as to convey information over
                    long distances. Coyotes developed a sound called a
                    bark-howl, it is a blend between a barks low intensity
                    warning and moves into a howl in the second part of the
                    vocalization to change a less threatening warning, Into a
                    more severe threat or alarm.
