            <h2>General Information</h2>
            <p>
                Coyotes are the most vocal wild canines, their speech consists of multiple complex combinations of barks, yips and howls that they use on a day-to-day basis.
                <br><br>
                Coyotes are able to produce a variety of crescendos, trills, modulations, pitches, tones, lips ( at the sides) and vocal chords. The makeup of these pattern combinations is unique to each coyote, therefore other family/ pack members can differentiate between each other by their signature howls and sounds. Coyote voices are probably as individual as our own.

            <h2>How Coyote's communicate</h2>
            <p>
                Eleven different forms of vocalization have been identified, but more study is required to determine the precise meanings of these sounds. This includes growls, huffs, woofs, barks, bark-howls, lone howls, group yip-howls, whines, greeting songs, and yelps.
                <br><br>
                Coyotes also use body language, including gestures to convey many different messages and they mainly communicate via eye contact and gestures.
                <br><br>
                Warnings, happiness, joy, anger, distress, disapproval, pain, hellos and whereabouts are some of the things coyotes express out-loud, although the majority of communications is quiet.

            <h2>What they use communication for</h2>
            <p>
                Mother coyotes use calls to signify their pups whether there’s danger, dinner, or other complex feelings. Their distinct yip-howl is used primarily to keep pack members in communication when separated, however it has also been used as a form of conveying a deeper emotion from the animal.
                <br><br>
                They also leave droppings and urinate on surfaces in order to notify other coyotes of their presence and their territory.

            <h2>Hockett’s uniqueness features</h2>
            <p>
                Coyotes use some of hockets uniqueness features one being structure, coyotes use bark to convey long distance threat at a low or medium intensity, howls are used to notify their presence to listeners as well as to convey information over long distances. Coyotes developed a sound called a bark-howl, it is a blend between a barks low intensity warning and moves into a howl in the second part of the vocalization to change a less threatening warning, Into a more severe threat or alarm.
